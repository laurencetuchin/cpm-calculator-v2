# Snapchat Advertising Guide 2024: Complete Setup & Cost Breakdown

Back in 2021, I launched my first Snapchat ad campaign for a beauty brand targeting Gen Z. With a modest $1,000 budget, we generated over 500 app installs at $2 each. What started as an experiment became a core channel in our marketing mix. Fast forward to 2024, and Snapchat has evolved into an even more powerful advertising platform, especially for brands targeting younger audiences.
