As a marketer or advertiser, calculating Cost Per Mille (CPM) is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of your campaigns. While Excel is a powerful tool for many calculations, using a dedicated CPM calculator can save you time and reduce errors. In this post, we'll explore how to create a CPM formula in Excel and why our online CPM calculator is a more efficient alternative.

## Creating the CPM Formula in Excel

To calculate CPM in Excel, you need three pieces of information:

1. Total cost of the campaign
2. Number of impressions
3. The CPM formula: (Total Cost / Number of Impressions) * 1000

Here's how you can set up the CPM calculation in Excel:

1. In cell A1, enter "Total Cost"
2. In cell A2, enter "Impressions"
3. In cell A3, enter "CPM"
4. In cell B1, enter your campaign's total cost
5. In cell B2, enter the number of impressions
6. In cell B3, enter the formula: =(B1/B2)*1000

This will give you the CPM for your campaign. While this method works, it requires manual setup and data entry each time you want to calculate CPM for a new campaign.
