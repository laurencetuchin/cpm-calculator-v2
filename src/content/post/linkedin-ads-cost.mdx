# LinkedIn Ads Cost in 2024: Complete B2B Advertising Guide (With Real Data)

Back in 2018, I launched my first LinkedIn ad campaign for a SaaS startup. The initial reaction to the $15 cost-per-click nearly gave our CEO a heart attack. But when those clicks turned into high-value enterprise deals worth $50,000+ each, everything changed. Fast forward to 2024, and while LinkedIn remains one of the more expensive advertising platforms, it continues to deliver some of the highest quality B2B leads in the digital marketing landscape.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down everything you need to know about LinkedIn advertising costs in 2024, backed by real campaign data and insights from years of managing successful B2B campaigns.

## The $5,000 Experiment: A Real Campaign Breakdown

Last quarter, I ran a detailed experiment with a $5,000 budget split across different LinkedIn ad formats. Here's what happened:

### Sponsored Content ($2,500)
- Impressions: 50,000
- Clicks: 200
- Leads: 15
- Cost per lead: $166
- Lead quality: Excellent (3 enterprise deals)

### Message Ads ($1,500)
- Delivered: 10,000

### Text Ads ($1,000)

The results showed that while Sponsored Content had the highest initial cost per lead, it generated the highest quality opportunities with the best close rates.
